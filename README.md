# Chest_X-ray_image_Disease_Classifier

The goal of this AI solution is to detect in real time diseases from chest x-ray images
using deep learning algorithms that leverage convolutional neural network to build
a model used in predictions. I developed a UI that allows a chest x-ray digital image to be uploaded and classified in real-time into any of the 13 different disease categories. It display this information in the form of a bar-chart with probablity in terms of percentage of each disease category.

**Classes of Diseases**

The following are the list of the 14 categories of diseases our dataset is associated with
for now:
1. Atelectasis
2. Cardiomegaly
3. Consolidation
4. Edema
5. Emphysema
6. Fibrosis
7. Hernia
8. Infiltration
9. Mass
10. Nodule
11. Plueral Thickening
12. Pneumonia
13. Pneumothorax
Note: It is possible to add more classes of disease.
